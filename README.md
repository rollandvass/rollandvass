# Oh.. you found me. Hi there, I'm Rolland! 👋
<h4>I'm a 3rd year CS student who likes to press keys and scroll on Stack Overflow instead of TikTok. Welcome to my profile!</h4>

## About Me

- 👨🏻‍💻 I’m currently learning React & Python
- 📌 Fun facts:
  - I like tinkering with Raspberry Pis and scripts. No, I'm not hacking anyone or anything (☉_☉)
  - I'm also a 'free-time' music producer — it's more of a hobby.
  - I have quite a tendency to start exploring CyberSecurity.
  - I love IoT stuff man.
  - No, I'm not wearing glasses anymore if you were wondering. 🧐

Oh, and did I mention? I have a soft spot for computer networking — it’s like the backbone that ties all my tech obsessions together.
